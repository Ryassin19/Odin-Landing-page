# Odin-Landing-page
This project is a landing page created as part of The Odin Project course. It is mainly focused on practicing CSS Flexbox to arrange content in a responsive way.

The page contains cards with images and text. Flexbox is used to align and space the cards so they adapt to different screen sizes.

The project uses only HTML and CSS and is meant as a learning exercise in building layouts with Flexbox.
